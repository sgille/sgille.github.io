My research focuses on ocean dynamics and their role in Earthâ€™s climate system.  My group's work is global in scope, with a strong focus on the Southern Ocean, as well as the California Current, which is a useful testbed for studying global processes. I use remote-sensing data, in situ observations, numerical model output within a broad dynamical framework.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Air-sea fluxes, especially at high latitudes including the Southern Ocean
- Biogeochemical processes and bio-physical interactions in the Southern Ocean.
- Diurnal variability in upper ocean temperature and surface winds.
- Small-scale processes in the ocean, and the possibilities from the SWOT satellite.
- Southern Ocean climate and dynamics. Wind-forcing of the Southern Ocean and heat transport via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and toward Antarctica.
